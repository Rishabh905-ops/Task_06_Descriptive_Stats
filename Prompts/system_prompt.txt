# Analysis of Losses

Observations:
-------------
- The team struggled most in close games decided by 1–2 points.
- High turnover rates (TO) in the 4th quarter contributed directly to losses.
- Shooting percentage (SH%) dropped significantly against top-ranked opponents.
- Defensive lapses led to higher goals allowed during transition plays.

Key Loss Factors:
-----------------
1. Turnovers in clutch situations (especially from midfield).
2. Over-reliance on Player X for scoring; lack of secondary scorers.
3. Poor ground ball recovery compared to opponent average.
4. Limited success in draw controls, leading to fewer possessions.

Supporting Data:
----------------
- Avg TO in losses: 14 vs 9 in wins.
- SH% in losses: 15% vs 23% in wins.
- Ground balls in losses: -8 differential per game.
