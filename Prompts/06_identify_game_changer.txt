# Identify the Game Changer

Candidate Player:
-----------------
- Player X: Highest usage, but efficiency gap (currently ~18% SH%).
- If Player X improves efficiency by 4–5 percentage points and reduces turnovers, team could add 2–3 extra wins.

Why Player X:
-------------
- High volume shooter → small improvements scale across many attempts.
- Central role in offense; touches the ball on 70% of possessions.
- Leadership potential → changes can influence teammates.

Game-Changer Metrics (Targets):
-------------------------------
- SH%: Raise from 18% → 22%.
- TO: Reduce from 3.5 per game → <2.5 per game.
- Contribution: +1.5 points per game expected.
